## Project

**Server Migration Redirect Demo**

A self-contained Docker Compose demo that simulates migrating a hostname from one server to another using nginx. It reverse-proxies HTTP on port 9092 and stream-proxies SSH on port 22, then performs a live cutover from `server-old` to `server-new` — with the client never changing what it connects to. Built as a migration proof-of-concept to run on a laptop.

**Core Value:** A live, on-stage flip of the nginx upstream from old to new where the client keeps hitting the same hostname and port, and unmistakably lands on the new server.

### Constraints

- **Tech stack**: nginx (with `stream` module) + Docker Compose — the demo is specifically about nginx behaviour, and Compose keeps it laptop-local and disposable
- **Ports**: HTTP on 9092, SSH on 22 — 9092 chosen explicitly by the user; SSH must be 22 to make the "no client change" point honestly
- **Environment**: must run entirely locally with no cloud account or cost
- **Startup**: one command to bring the whole demo up — a demo that needs setup steps isn't a demo

## GSD Workflow Enforcement

Before using Edit, Write, or other file-changing tools, start work through a GSD command so planning artifacts and execution context stay in sync.

Use these entry points:

- `/gsd-quick` for small fixes, doc updates, and ad-hoc tasks
- `/gsd-debug` for investigation and bug fixing
- `/gsd-execute-phase` for planned phase work

Do not make direct repo edits outside a GSD workflow unless the user explicitly asks to bypass it.
